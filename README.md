# Simple neural network with C#
A simple neural network in C#, without libraries

## Description
This project implements a simple neural network in C# from scratch, without using external machine learning libraries. The neural network is a single-layer perceptron that learns to solve a basic binary classification problem using matrix operations and the sigmoid activation function.
